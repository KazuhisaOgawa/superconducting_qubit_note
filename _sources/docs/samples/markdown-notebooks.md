# マークダウン、ノートブックス

Jupyter Book also lets you write text-based notebooks using MyST Markdown.
See [the Notebooks with MyST Markdown documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/file-types/myst-notebooks.html) for more detailed instructions.
This page shows off a notebook written in MyST Markdown.

## あAn example cell

With MyST Markdown, you can define code cells with a directive like so:

```{code-cell}
print(2 + 2)
```

When your book is built, the contents of any `{code-cell}` blocks will be
executed with your default Jupyter kernel, and their outputs will be displayed
in-line with the rest of your content.

```{seealso}
Jupyter Book uses [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to convert text-based files to notebooks, and can support [many other text-based notebook files](https://jupyterbook.org/file-types/jupytext.html).
```

## Create a notebook with MyST Markdown

MyST Markdown notebooks are defined by two things:

1. YAML metadata that is needed to understand if / how it should convert text files to notebooks (including information about the kernel needed).
   See the YAML at the top of this page for example.
2. The presence of `{code-cell}` directives, which will be executed with your book.

That's all that is needed to get started!

## Quickly add YAML metadata for MyST Notebooks

If you have a markdown file and you'd like to quickly add YAML metadata to it, so that Jupyter Book will treat it as a MyST Markdown Notebook, run the following command:

```
jupyter-book myst init path/to/markdownfile.md
```

\begin{gather*}
a_1=b_1+c_1\\
a_2=b_2+c_2-d_2+e_2
\end{gather*}

\begin{align}
a_{11}& =b_{11}&
  a_{12}& =b_{12}\\
a_{21}& =b_{21}&
  a_{22}& =b_{22}+c_{22}
\end{align}
